## Improvements
Here are a few things I have been thinking about, but discarded to make sure I reach at least an initial first version. Maybe I will extend this concept later, or someone else might take on the challenge to develop it further.

### Hardware
- RGB LED lighting: Requires buck-boost converter or similar to get to 5V, maybe larger battery, use WS2812 LEDs
- RGB LED in thumb switch: Cherry MX switches require 3mm LEDs, can't find as RGB, might need to improvise with SMD. Ideally use addressable LED (WS2812 or similar) to save pins
- Low-profile version: Different stem hole required, with Cherry MX Board 3.0 keycaps not possible to use plate (keycap too high)
- Add WiFi module (ESP8266 or similar) to receiver to allow for home automation control
- Case

### Software
- Control LED in thumb switch (e.g., to signal active layer: 2 LED = 4 Layers)
- Home automation control via WiFi module
