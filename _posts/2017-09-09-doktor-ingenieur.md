It is my pleasure to announce that I have achieved one of my dreams and received a doctoral degree with highest honor (summa cum laude) in Electrical and Computer Engineering with my thesis entitled "Security for Automotive Electrical/Electronic (E/E) Architectures", and may now call myself Dr.-Ing. Philipp Mundhenk.

The thesis is available [online as pdf](/files/SecurityForAutomotiveEEArchitectures_PhilippMundhenk_Dissertation.pdf), any book shop under ISBN 978-3-7369-9604-5, and of course on [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/dp/3736996047/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_wSeTzbNDQS9XV) or [amazon.com](http://a.co/ducg3it), etc.
